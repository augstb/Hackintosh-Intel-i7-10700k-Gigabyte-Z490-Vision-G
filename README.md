This repository contains WIP configuration files for an OpenCore build with **Gigabyte Z490 Vision G** motherboard and **Intel i7-10700k** *Comet Lake-S* desktop CPU.

So far so good using these configuration files for **Big Sur (11.0.1)**.

More details to come including tools and details about configuration.
